2,Condor's Nest,fdb3160f-5d19-3cd4-a21f-2cc65093ce86,"This should win many awards, at the Razzies. This is by far the worst attempt at a war film, that I'm guessing, was also trying to be funny in a Inglourious Basterds kind of way, but not even a smirk was cracked - more like cringe moments. This felt more like a long, dragged out bad SNL sketch. The 102 min runtime felt endless with terrible pacing and long dragged out and mostly unnecessary scenes. At best, this should've been a short film. The story was just flaccid, lame, and boring. I've seen better cast performances in a high school drama class, but I'm sure most of the blame falls on writer and director Phil Blattenberger's inexperience on how to direct his cast properly. I'm not sure why this nonsense was even made. The bogus high reviews are more entertaining. It's a very generous 3/10 from me, being very forgiving for many rookie mistakes by a newb filmmaker. Blattenberger should've at least consulted a more experienced filmmaker for the many needed areas of improvement.",4.4,1.5,"Action,War",FALSE,2023-01-27,Unknown

Trapped, he haltingly begins, but as the text's scansion sinks in, he shifts from a halting undifferentiated reading to one filled with meaning and rhythm, as if he's finally accessed his real self.

137,Legion of Super-Heroes,7e63f52e-e38a-3a43-a27c-fa11390b020c,"Less than a year after the release of 'Batman and Superman: Battle of the Super Sons' and 'Green Latern: Beware My Power', Josie Campbell rewrote the story of Kara Zor-EL/Supergirl (debut voice by Meg Donnelly) departing Krypton after Argon City was compromised earlier to join her cousin's Justice League as guardians of the earth.

Brainiac 5 is Supergirl's interest in the 31st century's legionnaires training academy where most viewers would assume a development of her relationship with the charming team lead Mon El (just like the couple's affair in CW's 'Supergirl' Seasons 5–6) who gave her a first tour of the academy. Defeated by Supergirl's newly acquainted squad, the first sign of her bonding with other legions of superheroes at the academy, Mon El revealed his secretive service to a rebuilt prime version of Brainiac 5's first grand ancestor. Merged in deformed Brainiac 2–4 with an enhanced intelligence and will power, shockingly gruesome for an animation visual and voice effects, this grisly vice of the Dark Circle is a scene stealer albeit his modus operandi did not work out. The academy's vault was saved by the legions from redefining the universe by the deadly circle.

Jeff Wamester will return to direct part two of Kara's venture between unfinished business with her fellow legions in the 31st Century and lifesaving mission with her home team on Earth. Both tomorrowverse phasings give huge fans to watch their favorite superheroine back in action on television since the CW's live action series has been cancelled in 2021.

Engineered by an all South Korean artistic team of DC Studios, subsidiary of Warner Bros.

144,Legion of Super-Heroes,7e63f52e-e38a-3a43-a27c-fa11390b020c,"DC's animated movies are usually pretty decent. This is just awful. The animation is choppy when it's actually animated, and it uses a lot of bad CGI. They really cheaped out on the quality and it shows.

The script and acting direction is also really weak. When it's every single person I blame the direction and not the actors themselves.

I can forgive something that looks terrible if it is compelling, but it's not. It rushes everything and gives nothing time to breath. 

For no apparent reason they give you a 15-minute rehash of Supergirl's origin story before they get into the actual plot. It has an 83 minute runtime, so I guess they just didn't have 83 minutes worth of story and decided to fill some time with an origin story...but if you're gonna do that, pick a character that hasn't been done to death. I really hate when they hit you with an abridged origin story in these things, especially when it's one that's been done in movies and TV multiple times already. 

If it was an origin story for Cosmic Boy, that'd be something the general public aren't familiar with, and it'd be one of the founding members of the Legion of Super-Heroes making it more appropriate for the movie.

Hell, make the whole movie an origin story of the three founding members, get people to know who they are. 

Or...make it a Supergirl movie, because that's what it basically is anyways. Cut out the origin story, cut out the time travel, make it a ""Superman is busy, someone has to stop Lex Luthor and his hired goons."" 

I don't care so much about what direction they go, they can do the Supergirl joins the Legion story, just animate it well and make it compelling, starting with cutting out the 15 minutes of nonsense at the start.",6.0,0.5,"Action,Adventure,Animation",FALSE,2023-02-07,Unknown

Brainiac 5 is Supergirl's interest in the 31st century's legionnaires training academy where most viewers would assume a development of her relationship with the charming team lead Mon El (just like the couple's affair in CW's 'Supergirl' Seasons 5–6) who gave her a first tour of the academy. Defeated by Supergirl's newly acquainted squad, the first sign of her bonding with other legions of superheroes at the academy, Mon El revealed his secretive service to a rebuilt prime version of Brainiac 5's first grand ancestor. Merged in deformed Brainiac 2–4 with an enhanced intelligence and will power, shockingly gruesome for an animation visual and voice effects, this grisly vice of the Dark Circle is a scene stealer albeit his modus operandi did not work out. The academy's vault was saved by the legions from redefining the universe by the deadly circle.

Jeff Wamester will return to direct part two of Kara's venture between unfinished business with her fellow legions in the 31st Century and lifesaving mission with her home team on Earth. Both tomorrowverse phasings give huge fans to watch their favorite superheroine back in action on television since the CW's live action series has been cancelled in 2021.

Like, why kara is beeing kick out the earth, why they can contact the rest of the legion, who is the infiltrade in academy of heroes. Why dont you show this things insted of telling littery what is happening.
I would love it if kept the mystery of who kill tripiclate girl longer to us and making suspect braniac or other academy hero members, it would be gold but no. They show how has right in the begging and, the worst thing ever, later they made Mon EL make a villan speech like "" I'm the one behind this"" ( WE ALREDY KNEW ) , and NOBODY suspected of him?? ( not even the smartest guy in the universe ) and the shapeshifter pet knew and didnot told kara, or braniac, or the legion leader, or any one. 
The animation and aacting is good, and the reason why braniac do what he is doing it can be authentic and understanble. The look of the endless circle is soo AMAZING and the ending of braniac 1 death its just great, the pride of all the braniacs kill him.

316,Last Sentinel,7e63f52e-e38a-3a43-a27c-fa11390b020c,"DC's animated movies are usually pretty decent. This is just awful. The animation is choppy when it's actually animated, and it uses a lot of bad CGI. They really cheaped out on the quality and it shows.

The script and acting direction is also really weak. When it's every single person I blame the direction and not the actors themselves.

I can forgive something that looks terrible if it is compelling, but it's not. It rushes everything and gives nothing time to breath. 

For no apparent reason they give you a 15-minute rehash of Supergirl's origin story before they get into the actual plot. It has an 83 minute runtime, so I guess they just didn't have 83 minutes worth of story and decided to fill some time with an origin story...but if you're gonna do that, pick a character that hasn't been done to death. I really hate when they hit you with an abridged origin story in these things, especially when it's one that's been done in movies and TV multiple times already. 

If it was an origin story for Cosmic Boy, that'd be something the general public aren't familiar with, and it'd be one of the founding members of the Legion of Super-Heroes making it more appropriate for the movie.

Hell, make the whole movie an origin story of the three founding members, get people to know who they are. 

Or...make it a Supergirl movie, because that's what it basically is anyways. Cut out the origin story, cut out the time travel, make it a ""Superman is busy, someone has to stop Lex Luthor and his hired goons."" 

I don't care so much about what direction they go, they can do the Supergirl joins the Legion story, just animate it well and make it compelling, starting with cutting out the 15 minutes of nonsense at the start.",6.0,0.5,"Action,Adventure,Animation",FALSE,2023-02-07,Unknown

No world breaker but a very nice way to pass the time. Ally is a TV reality show producer. When her previously successful show gets cancelled she decides to return home to Washington state for a reset. There she meets Sean, who she was in strong relationship with many years ago. They instantly click again and Ally thinks they might be able to get together again. But the next day she finds out he is actually engaged to Cassidy. So ensues a dilemma for Ally as deep down she wants to stop the marriage but doesn't know how. She also gets to know Cassidy and like her as she reminds her of herself many years ago. It makes for many awkward situations and back and forth as the film navigates the perils of love. It's all fairly entertaining without any real weight.

Trapped, he haltingly begins, but as the text's scansion sinks in, he shifts from a halting undifferentiated reading to one filled with meaning and rhythm, as if he's finally accessed his real self.

Brainiac 5 is Supergirl's interest in the 31st century's legionnaires training academy where most viewers would assume a development of her relationship with the charming team lead Mon El (just like the couple's affair in CW's 'Supergirl' Seasons 5–6) who gave her a first tour of the academy. Defeated by Supergirl's newly acquainted squad, the first sign of her bonding with other legions of superheroes at the academy, Mon El revealed his secretive service to a rebuilt prime version of Brainiac 5's first grand ancestor. Merged in deformed Brainiac 2–4 with an enhanced intelligence and will power, shockingly gruesome for an animation visual and voice effects, this grisly vice of the Dark Circle is a scene stealer albeit his modus operandi did not work out. The academy's vault was saved by the legions from redefining the universe by the deadly circle.

Jeff Wamester will return to direct part two of Kara's venture between unfinished business with her fellow legions in the 31st Century and lifesaving mission with her home team on Earth. Both tomorrowverse phasings give huge fans to watch their favorite superheroine back in action on television since the CW's live action series has been cancelled in 2021.

Engineered by an all South Korean artistic team of DC Studios, subsidiary of Warner Bros.

488,Billie Eilish: Live At The O2,7e63f52e-e38a-3a43-a27c-fa11390b020c,"DC's animated movies are usually pretty decent. This is just awful. The animation is choppy when it's actually animated, and it uses a lot of bad CGI. They really cheaped out on the quality and it shows.

The script and acting direction is also really weak. When it's every single person I blame the direction and not the actors themselves.

I can forgive something that looks terrible if it is compelling, but it's not. It rushes everything and gives nothing time to breath. 

For no apparent reason they give you a 15-minute rehash of Supergirl's origin story before they get into the actual plot. It has an 83 minute runtime, so I guess they just didn't have 83 minutes worth of story and decided to fill some time with an origin story...but if you're gonna do that, pick a character that hasn't been done to death. I really hate when they hit you with an abridged origin story in these things, especially when it's one that's been done in movies and TV multiple times already. 

If it was an origin story for Cosmic Boy, that'd be something the general public aren't familiar with, and it'd be one of the founding members of the Legion of Super-Heroes making it more appropriate for the movie.

Hell, make the whole movie an origin story of the three founding members, get people to know who they are. 

Or...make it a Supergirl movie, because that's what it basically is anyways. Cut out the origin story, cut out the time travel, make it a ""Superman is busy, someone has to stop Lex Luthor and his hired goons.""

Still, the world of literary ambition (or any ambition) came across. The humor is more droll than bust-a-gut funny, which I like. Kate Hudson is just incredible in it. The best thing I've seen her do, perhaps it was going toe-to-to with the great Michael Shannon. Or maybe the directing. It doesn't matter. The supporting cast was perfect. Da'Vine Joy Randolph was funny and perfect.  I loved the young woman who played the hotel clerk. Her facial expressions along were priceless.

Having his book brought to life with Kate Hudson as lead was truly amazing. Especially cool was the way the movie director put author Chris in a cameo as a guitar-playing Shriver fan. Michael Shannon did a great job as Shriver and I've been a fan of Zach Braff since Scrubs and Don Johnson since Miami Vice, so A+ on the casting. If you're looking for intelligent drama, romance, dashes of comedy, and a twist ending, this is it. If you want an overdose of CGI, 3-D, or lots of things blowing up, this movie won't be for you.

It can be a bit triggering if you grew up in that world - hence Braff getting the script right.
