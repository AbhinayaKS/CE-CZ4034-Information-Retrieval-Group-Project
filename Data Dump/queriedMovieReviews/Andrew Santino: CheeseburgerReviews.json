COVID, wow, what a great topic. That dead horse has been beaten so much it's turned into a fine mist. Politics, you know a true hack when they have to rely on outdated political jokes that just aren't good in the first place. You never hear anyone say \"Remember that great joke (legendary comedians name here) said about (president of that time)?\" Because great comedians don't do hacky political comedy that will never stand the test of time."}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 0.5, "isInterested": null, "comment": "Unoriginal and the closing joke was just a bad shane gillis ripoff.\nAwesome podcaster, bad standup."}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 1.5, "isInterested": null, "comment": "I wanted to love it, but I didn't find much that was funny.

Some comedians are good joke-wrighters, some are storytellers, some are entertainers. Andrew is a good mix of all, but mostly he is just a funny person.  Of course comedy is subjective, and everything is not for everyone - but for me this was great."}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 3.5, "isInterested": null, "comment": "Despite being a fan of Santino for a long time through both of his podcasts, I found this special to be a little lackluster. I think it's appropriate that it's called cheeseburger; it fills you up and is simple and tasty, but it's not a steak dinner. The first 15 minutes are rough and repetitive, with classic covid jokes, but it picks up and becomes quite enjoyable after that."}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 5, "isInterested": null, "comment": "As a podcast fan, I've seen other comedian podcasters comedy specials after only hearing them on podcasts and I have been disappointed in the past.

He appears to be a charming, decent guy. The issue is that he is just not that funny. It is not that he is offensive, or too esoteric. He covers a variety of topics, from the pandemic to sexuality to growing up in the 80's. His delivery is natural. His jokes and storytelling might be ok if he was a friend of yours, but not enough to conquer a Live audience. One of the other issues with the special is that he is also the Director and it is not shot very well. The special keeps going back and forth between two camera angles and it it a little distracting. I like Netflix comedy and try them all. This was very average, at best."}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 5, "isInterested": null, "comment": "Absolutely one of my favorite hours!
