Andie McDowell is an aging actress who learns she has 4 stage cancer. The supporting cast gives support for her to let her know how they have fought the cancer.  Each person is at a different stage in the fight.  No light issue by no means.  I thought it was an interesting perspective on someone who decides to chose not to go through the treatment and use the time to enjoy whatever time she has left with her loved ones.  I thought the movie was alright."}]}}, "emsId": "b299b8bf-e9e7-42bf-85f2-140e848d3dd6", "emsVersionId": "70cf233e-0e21-47b6-8887-ae0a18dce6aa", "movie_name": "My Happy Ending"}
