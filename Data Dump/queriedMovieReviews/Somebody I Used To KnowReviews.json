This movie definitely leans more into the dramatic side, but I think it comes from a place of honesty and is told with many humorous moments. The characters make plenty of mistakes but I think it makes them feel more genuine. I respected the ending of the movie went with and think it is something most young people reflecting on the people we used to know when we were younger can connect with. Overall, it is a charming movie that hits some familiar genre beats, but also has some sharp writing that gives it a voice of its own."}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 1, "isInterested": null, "comment": "A woefully unfunny script sinks  great work from its star."}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 4, "isInterested": null, "comment": "A very enjoyable movie.

No world breaker but a very nice way to pass the time. Ally is a TV reality show producer. When her previously successful show gets cancelled she decides to return home to Washington state for a reset. There she meets Sean, who she was in strong relationship with many years ago. They instantly click again and Ally thinks they might be able to get together again. But the next day she finds out he is actually engaged to Cassidy. So ensues a dilemma for Ally as deep down she wants to stop the marriage but doesn't know how. She also gets to know Cassidy and like her as she reminds her of herself many years ago. It makes for many awkward situations and back and forth as the film navigates the perils of love. It's all fairly entertaining without any real weight. But it's worth a watch alone for the presence of Alison Brie as Ally. Her sweetness and humour are always a winning combination."}]}}, "emsId": "15ef8941-65ce-4e10-b83e-0ccd2597d56f", "emsVersionId": "9d9f524d-05b5-40f7-bc95-31d5e7cff9cc", "movie_name": "Somebody I Used To Know"}
