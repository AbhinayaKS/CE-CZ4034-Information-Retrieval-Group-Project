The colors are beautiful and the 3D is worth your money. The sc\u00e8nes are beautiful. Action keeps you gripped. However it could be done in 30 minutes less. And towards the ending you feel it is a set up for a sequel. That makes the end little less satisfying.

It took a large team of humans a lot of work to make this, and it delivers the goods.... excellent entertainment!  You may want to avoid if you don't like guns, explosions, or killing in your cinema.  The acting, camera work, 3d effects were in a good pocket, the camera, graphics, and score are excellent... nice to return to Pandora once again!"}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 1.5, "isInterested": null, "comment": "Wanted to enjoy this but it's just so generic in its storytelling that I completely lost interest."}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 5, "isInterested": null, "comment": "The movie is directed by James Cameron and was release the 14 december 2022 ( in french ) the mains caractere are lo'ak and his brother whereas their parent were the mains caractere in the fisrt movie.

The movie is incredible, at the end I don't have worlds to discribe what I saw, actors are so good, spectacular with the stage kn the water when they learned to drive the animal. Avatar is a fantastique movie with sp\u00e9cial effect with splendid background, nature, in the cloud, in the water, When I saw that I want to be with their. The photography is really incredible and submersion, all are very good. The movie gives lots of emotions, empathy, happy, surprise by the level of the movie. Generraly I don't like movies but I think it was a good idea ton see this movie and I'm not disappointed. The very long shot were insane, it's the best movie that I never see, the story is good, the caractere were outstanding and lovable. And I don't forget the song which give the rhytm and add more emotion that we have with the picture, I will never forget this movie, it's the best for me. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves emotional and action scene with incredible background and long shoot, go now to see it if you haven't see this movie"}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 5, "isInterested": null, "comment": "The movie is directed by James Cameron and is the sequel of Avatar 1.
