Zach Braff's script hit home for me having been around addiction my whole life, he got the nuances correct even with throwing in the trope of rummaging under the sink for old pill bottles (it's a trope for a reason) and the hidden bottle of whiskey in the china cabinet (my dad hid vodka). It can be a bit triggering if you grew up in that world - hence Braff getting the script right. Molly Shannon was perfect on pushing the buttons of all enablers who think they are helping, and played the part teetering on the truth edge of annoying. But the love within and throughout the movie drives the story. Well done to the amazing cast. Well done Zach. I'll be watching this again!"}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 4.5, "isInterested": null, "comment": "Halfway thru this movie I stopped and looked at my daughter and said wow the acting in this movie is amazing I loved how the movie wasn't predictable great story great emotion"}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 5, "isInterested": null, "comment": "This is the most beautiful movie about someone surviving a tragic event, struggling to fight through the pain, and ultimately trying to become a better person because of it.

The movie was a smidge contrived but really good, Interesting and well done. I even cried a little (more than a little). Florence is outstanding (although she could do a Burger King commercial and her performance would be Oscar worthy). Again...ignore the critics."}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 5, "isInterested": null, "comment": "this was inspirational and beautiful"}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 4, "isInterested": null, "comment": "\"A Good Person\" is a good movie.
