The acting is a bit over the top and not very good despite the actors all having done good stuff before but there isn't much for them to work with here. The jokes are very hit or miss with 60% missing, 20% getting a slight smile and 20% I actually laughed at. The cinematography is not very good either with a lot of gross out jokes that aren't well done and very basic camerawork. The music is all over the place with dated early millennium pop songs, dumb musical numbers and generic romance tracks that don't go that well together. The editing is not that good either as it feels this film loses focus quite often in the middle. This isn't that long though and I never felt like it drags on. Honestly it's a dated Teen Romcom Spoof film that isn't that good. I really can't recommend this to anyone other than people who grew up with it and just laughing how dated and subpar it is."}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 1, "isInterested": null, "comment": "Funny moments but mostly terrible writing and acting"}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 5, "isInterested": null, "comment": "I've been quoting this movie for years.

You know where all the scenes are coming from in this spoof on John Waters films or Kirschner reprising her role from Exotica and also mixing in Cruel Intentions (Canadian Jewish girl wearing Catholic girl clothes).  Amazing a lot of the actors made it out of this: Chris Evans & Lacey Chabert, Mia Kirschner, Chyler Leigh, & Jamie Presley."}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 5, "isInterested": null, "comment": "This film is one of my favorites.

Like any spoof comedy flick, you'll immediately shoot yourself in the foot if you're looking for award winning acting and screenplay.  If you lower your standards and just want to put something on to laugh, this will do the trick every time.  There are countless laugh-out-loud scenes, it's absolutely ludicrous, inappropriate and socially relevant.  I still watch this at least once a year if I'm in need of a raucous chuckle."}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 4, "isInterested": null, "comment": "I guess 7 out of 10 critics are incapable of just sitting back and enjoying some simple crude humor."}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 5, "isInterested": null, "comment": "I find this film to be highly underrated. An onslaught of never ending jokes and references that brings Airplane! like details into every scene. The casting is great, it's raunchy and perfectly fits the time period and genre. The only problem is you are required to have seen the large number of films they are spoofing ahead of time. That shouldn't be a problem if you are already a fan of teen movies."}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 5, "isInterested": null, "comment": "Such low ratings for a hilarious parody movie? people have zero sense of humor, this movie is hilarious and makes fun of all the pathetic teen movie classics "}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 5, "isInterested": null, "comment": "This is probably the premier movie of my tween years. My dad incorrectly assumed I had seen enough gratuitous nudity in my ~10 years of life that it would be fine for me to watch this movie on my grandpa's Dish network box that'd been hacked for free PPV. For years afterwards anytime I'd go to grandpa's house I'd look for it to be playing on HBO and would sometimes find it there, ready for me to not understand any of the references while I looked at the boobies. Anyway, now that I'm an adult with the goal of watching every wide-release/important movie from 2001, I looked forward to seeing this so much that I spent months watching all of the movies that were referenced by it first, most of them for the very first time. It was a wildly fulfilling sub-quest in my overall movie adventure and it achieved its goal of making this an even more entertaining movie for me. I can see how the jokes wouldn't necessarily land at a high rate for those who didn't do the homework like I did, but for me this was just a perfect mix of nostalgia, belly laughs, and fulfillment from my hard work paying off. Woohoo!"}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 1.5, "isInterested": null, "comment": "This is possibly the worst spoof movie I've ever had the misfortune to watch. Very unimpressed. Way too much sexual content. Its just unnecessary. Weak jokes with good delivery - its odd. Can't recommend."}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 5, "isInterested": null, "comment": "All I want from a movie like this is to laugh.  This one made me laugh - hard - so many times, and I'm guessing there were a lot of gags in the background that I missed.  First viewing was in 2021, but I grew up with many of the films it satirizes.  IMO this film better reproduces the experience of reading The National Lampoon in the early 1980's, when it was bold and fearless, than any other."}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 3, "isInterested": null, "comment": "At least much better than the many bad spoofs that followed. Plus at least Chris Evans some how became a star after this movie. Not many stars were made from the other spoofs that of decade.\nThere's actually laughs in this movie when films like Epic Movie or Dance Flick just made me regret even watching them."}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 3, "isInterested": null, "comment": "It was a good movie until it started to become a musical when there was no singing or dancing in the rest of the movie, it was kinda random (singing and dancing)"}]}}, "emsId": "812fa78b-7864-4237-9b03-8875f8a8990b", "emsVersionId": "926c327f-fc00-445b-9b47-4e470d168958", "movie_name": "2023 test PROD Movie"}
