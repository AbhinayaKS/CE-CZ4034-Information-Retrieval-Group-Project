They did a really good job of executing the surprise at the end. If you like movies that make you go \"holy moly, I didn't see that coming!\" then this is definitely rewarding. Super solid performances throughout the whole film. And super legit flick as it had that guy from the Saw movies. Super cool. Def worth watching."}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 5, "isInterested": null, "comment": "ReBroken is a movie of you want to watch closely and even want to rewatch it to puzzle all the pieces together.
