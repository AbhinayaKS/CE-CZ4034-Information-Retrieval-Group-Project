Children will enjoy it with all of the action and cute characters, while adults will find a meaningful message inside it. The plot is fun and engaging, but there are so many hidden details in this film that make you want to watch it on repeat."}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 5, "isInterested": null, "comment": "Part love story, part social satire, part prophetic dystopian future. The first half of the movie contains solely three words along with some beeps and some whirring yet the love story between two robots still manages to be transfixing. The second half of the film boldly calls us all out as complacent, overindulgent consumerists who continue said lifestyle despite the overwhelming evidence of its harm to ourselves and the world. These thematic intricacies are often reserved for more adult films, but the way Pixar manages to take those themes and sand their edges down while still retaining their shape is truly admirable. Juggling all of those pieces with minimal dialogue and a (largely) non-human cast seems near impossible in a kid's movie, but Pixar manages to stick the landing with arguably the most complex and well executed animated film of all time."}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 4, "isInterested": null, "comment": "Pixar at its best, a story with no words, except for a very slight dialogue. Mostly a story about watching two individual robots, fall in love, and the journey and adventure that they have to embark on. Disney really went all out with this film, you think that it wouldn't be something entertaining for a child, but you understand that when you take away the words, and you have to physically watch and pay attention, a draw your attention more to the screen so you can understand exactly what's going on. Disney did that bold and beautiful with this movie"}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 4.5, "isInterested": null, "comment": "There are some takes in this show that probably wouldn't be done today, but overall is a fun watch."}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 5, "isInterested": null, "comment": "One of my top movies.
