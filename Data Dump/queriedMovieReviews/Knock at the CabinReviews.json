Wonderful acting, and Shyamalan shows again that he still has \"it\" and can create an incredibly captivating film from start to finish. I highly recommend"}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 5, "isInterested": null, "comment": "I thought this movie was awesome.

Although I kind of knew who the 4 individuals represented in the movie, the storyline was still intense. Great acting. Great cast."}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 2.5, "isInterested": null, "comment": "Another movie I was really looking forward to but wasn't that thrilled with. Can't really put my finger on it. Just felt like it was wrapped up neatly and and packaged to give the best ending possible. Looked up the original ending and it's exactly what the movie needed because without it it seems too paint by the numbers."}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 3, "isInterested": null, "comment": "O filme \u00e9 instigante do in\u00edcio a quase o final. Imagina-se uma conclus\u00e3o surpreendente, mas isso n\u00e3o \u00e9 encontrado. Se o espectador quiser dar asas \u00e0 sua imagina\u00e7\u00e3o e, com isso, superar a falha do filme, muito bem.

Not knowing exactly what is going on is not a new thing for movies, especially M. Night movies, but this one is well done. I was kept intently invested as the whole thing unfolded."}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 4.5, "isInterested": null, "comment": "People's hate for the Bible will keep them from enjoying this great movie"}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 0.5, "isInterested": null, "comment": "The only thing that movies brings to the table is that Dave Bautista can take on serious roles. "}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 3.5, "isInterested": null, "comment": "The reality that Shyamalan creates for his characters offers limited room for the viewer to have any reasonable doubt.  I think for this to be more of a thriller horror film, i would have preferred less justification from the characters actions, and more of an overall sense of delusion, and allow the film viewer to develop their own speculations. Overall the cinematography was very well done, with very close camera scenes, the characters in a way are intruding the viewer's personal space."}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 1.5, "isInterested": null, "comment": "The acting was fine but the pace and the story were horrible. I really don't know how M Knight's movies keep being funded. After 20 minutes I googled the ending and fast forwarded."}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 4, "isInterested": null, "comment": "Very intense thriller. If you haven't read the book you had no idea of the outcome.  M.Night Shyamalan best film since Unbreakable."}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 4.5, "isInterested": null, "comment": "Didn't read the book before I saw it, but now I know there are some significant differences.

Can not elaborate emotions and kept flat affect.  Completely disappointing ending."}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 1, "isInterested": null, "comment": "Acting is alright but the camerawork and story are awful.

It's just that the premise itself is so shockingly stupid. It doesn't have anywhere to go once the basic premise is revealed. And then\u2026 it's insulting that characters would actually respond in such contrived ways. It's not interesting nor suspenseful; just dumb."}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 4, "isInterested": null, "comment": "Intriguing premise, tension filled but would have liked a Shyamalan twist at the end."}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 3, "isInterested": null, "comment": "I kept waiting for something that simply never came.
