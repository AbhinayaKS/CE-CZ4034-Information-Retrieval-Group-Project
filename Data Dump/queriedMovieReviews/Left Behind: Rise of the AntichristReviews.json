Ouch. The just shall live by faith. Not proof. That's science.\nLeaving a false teaching pastor behind to  witness and get them saved the few lost that stumble in \ud83d\ude06oh  irony. He don't  Know the truth \nthat's why he is left behind?  Come on ya'll. The Holy Spirit dwells in the believers and the believers are gone soo..who is saving after the rapture comes \ud83d\udc40??If the Holy Spur left with his peoples?\nThe only way this works is set dispensation theology aside and view this all happening while and before the catching away of \n1 Thessalonians  4. That's a movie plot \nSatan taking over while Christian's are still here thinking they should be gone \nScary \ud83d\ude27"}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 4, "isInterested": null, "comment": "I'm surprised because some faith and spirituality movies feel off somehow. This one felt well-paced, had a lot better acting than other movies, and it felt more real in its depictions of hate crimes, too. I really liked it!

I like the characters like Rayford Steele, Cameron \"Buck\" Williams, Chloe Steele, Nicolae Carpathia, Jonathan Stonagal, and even Pastor Bruce Barnes. I love how it showed how the world would react to the Rapture and how the world tries to downplay what really happened. I also love how they portray even the Antichrist by making people think that Stonagal is the Antichrist, but Nicolae Carpathia comes in a shocking way and kills Stonagal showing that Jonathan Stonagal wasn't the Man of lawlessness, but that Nicolae is. I also love that at the end Rayford, Barnes, Chloe, and Buck all run and hide when Buck shows that the Bible predicted all these end times events  and that people need to look and see that we need to seek Jesus Christ now for tomorrow may never come."}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 4, "isInterested": null, "comment": "The Truth will set you free, if you choose to believe."}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 5, "isInterested": null, "comment": "Amazibgly Genuine Movie.
