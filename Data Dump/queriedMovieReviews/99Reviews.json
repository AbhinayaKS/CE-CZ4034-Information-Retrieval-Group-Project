Instead, each story has similarities to the other, and in many instances, the films are just sad and downright depressing.

The fact that there is no inner and outer story anymore, that these stories are not combined, that none of the stories benefit from technology, and worse yet, that they do not reflect the period are the developments that upset me, who love the series very freaking much. The series, which had a richer structure under 8383 Productions and The Collective Studios, was simplified under Shudder. It wouldn't be surprising if Shudder, known for its low-budget horrors, would shrink under it, but shrinking the vision may not be good for the series. However, I can say that I would not say no to a possible sequel that will continue to come every October. It's never too late to get back to their roots."}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 2, "isInterested": null, "comment": "Not the best in the V/H/S series, but by no means was this a bad film. Aside from the Medusa short, VHS99 did not supply a whole lot of jump scares or concepts to get invested in. Shredding, Suicide Bid, and Ozzy's Dungeon were more exploitation/psychological horror (spamming the use of the obnoxious bully antagonist trope), while To Hell and Back felt pretentious at times and was very hard to buy into. Perhaps it was this lack of variety amongst the shorts, all having relied too heavily on that \"type\" of antagonist. \n\nVHS94's shorts (namely Terror and Storm Drain) were very hard to top from a plot/narrative standpoint, while The Subject absolutely mastered the action-oriented and exploitation themes. So, this VHS99 did feel like a step down in that regard."}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 1, "isInterested": null, "comment": "Not a fan. Maybe it's just not for me but I like the found footage idea but it's like a collage of different random stories instead of connecting them at the end. I get their trying to combine short stories into one big movie but it comes as boring. It would be like if the twilight zone instead of separating episodes they combined them into a movie. It wouldn't work. What would be a cool idea is if this was a tv show for shudder and seeing different stories that way and breaking them up into individual episodes. In the end they should turn it into a show not a movie.

I'm not the biggest fan of found footage, or anthology movies, but this one does a pretty good job at it. There's no bookend story which is a positive for me. The last 2 VHS movies, I didn't care for the bookend story's, so I'm glad that's not in this one. There's a good story about a girl getting buried alive, another good one with a hot neighbor that's actually freakin Medusa. And the one about demons was decent. The first story though I didn't like at all. The characters were very annoying. Overall I'd recommend it though."}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 1.5, "isInterested": null, "comment": "The final story was excellent, I'd give that 4 stars.
