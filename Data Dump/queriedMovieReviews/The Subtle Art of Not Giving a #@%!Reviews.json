He was personable and I enjoyed hearing him talk about his life and revelations, but this went on way too long for a feature. The stories about people giving away too many fucks were essentially retold with a myriad of graphics and a barrage of film clips. IMHO, it should've been cut to about an hour and dragged a bit for its message. I really wanted to love this movie because I enjoyed the book so much. As it is in so many cases: the book was much better.

It's a nice companion to the book but added nothing new and leaving a lot out.  If you haven't read the book, there is plenty to like.  My wife enjoyed the movie and found value in what he had to say.  \n\nI recommend this movie for two types of people:\n1. Those that haven't read the book and want to know what it's about.\n2. Those with time to kill that enjoyed the book."}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 2, "isInterested": null, "comment": "The book? Great. The movie? Meh.

Instead of trying to feel good all the time, figure out what you're willing to feel bad for. Stoicism with a dollop of Buddhism, but framed in a down-to-earth, modern-day, lens that most Americans born between 1980-2000, will find super relatable.\n\nMark and his books are a 10/10. The documentary (which considering the source material, would be difficult to produce) is a 5/10.
