Typically, I have a hard time with movies, especially when I watch them late at night and after having a few beers. Actually, 99% of the movies I watch end up with me falling asleep before finishing them. But when I watched The Last Deal, I was completely captivated! I didn't even blink once! The music was perfect and set the tone, and the plot was simple yet stunning. There was a particular scene (you know the one) that left my jaw on the floor! It was such a rush! Indie flicks like this one are proving that all you need is a great story, talented actors, and a skilled director to make something special. I absolutely adored this film and would happily watch it again just for the vibe alone."}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 4, "isInterested": null, "comment": "Really tense.

I don't understand the positive rotten tomatoes score. The scenes are cheesy. The dialogue is stale. The ending is unsatisfying. Overall, save your $5 to rent this movie on Amazon prime.

It's a solid indie crime movie and tense AF.

Didn't know what to expect since it's a micro-budget film.  It's incredible what they pulled off.  Very tense and had glimmers of Michael Mann.  Kept me entertained, moves pretty fast to not be entertained."}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 1, "isInterested": null, "comment": "I would've been more entertained by watching a repeat of Shark Tank.  Not the Saturday night action packed thriller we were looking for this evening. Still scratching my head at the 100 tomatoes score that made us choose it."}]}}, "emsId": "79f389d1-0082-46ec-b4af-a8a8ab87c66d", "emsVersionId": "315c4b3c-a9fd-4023-9c10-2f175e344c23", "movie_name": "The Last Deal"}
