And I'll watch it with people close to me next time.\n\nFinal rating: 5/5, though I might be more biased towards it since this is the one Disney+ movie and streaming service movie that I've been most looking forward to and wanna see succeed. \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\n\nP.S. There is one mid-credits scene to stay for as it sets up the future of where this character goes next."}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 5, "isInterested": null, "comment": "Everything about this movie is amazing!!

I mean, who exactly is this film for? This is a film taking a lot of ques from Roger Rabbit right down to the neo-nior kind of of vibe. Also like Roger Rabbit it has some surprising adult content in the show.. like their version of being dipped, bootlegging leading toons to be forced into low rent knock off movies. There are porn jokes, Monterey Jack is a crack addict.. I mean cheese addict... it is just strange. They have taken a 89 cartoon and tried to make it appeal to the people that used to watch it who would probably all be in their late 30s, early 40s. So the tone of this is all over the place. It is not dark enough to be another Chocolate Bunnies of the Apocalypse, but it is not exactly for kids, but I think kids could probably watch it without really getting it.\n\nIt is just a odd movies and not unique. Disney+ has a number of old school cartoons coming out soon as films on stream, but aimed at adults. Phineas and Ferb a 2007 cartoon is supposedly getting the same treatment. We got the Rocko's modern Life one a while back and they did it with Invader Zim, but that should have been way darker. He-Man on netflix, though a utter disaster was the same kind of this, as was Voltron. I think we are now in a time where the corporations have realised that media whores are now old and many still watch the same cartoons they did as a kid. There is defiantly a market for shows based on these famous ips that are actually sorta made for the adults, not a new generation of kids. The idea of making one of these IPs but NOT making it a family thing, but marketing it directly to the fans of the original.\n\nVerdict : I'm not sure if this movie is good or not, to be honest I just got it out of curiosity and flicked through it... but I do think WHAT this film is, is actually pretty interesting. Wonder if I'll get a dark and gritty spaghetti western style version of Lucky Luke or a brutally realistic spy thriller with TinTin?"}]}}, "emsId": "7a2ab246-08aa-4650-bf35-6ad242f6f140", "emsVersionId": "7d598ef6-71a1-44cc-8d5d-3c832ca7c8ec", "movie_name": "Chip 'n' Dale: Rescue Rangers"}
