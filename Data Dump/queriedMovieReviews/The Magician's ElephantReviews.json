The story is interesting, but not very daring - it's totally stuck in the main narrative.  Some themes needed more depth, but the plot is entertaining.  As much as it was not very creative, it was a pleasant experience and left an extremely positive balance.  The moral lesson is very well crafted, always reminding us how we must never lose hope, regardless of the challenge."}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 3.5, "isInterested": null, "comment": "I enjoyed this movie , emotions hit at perfect moments and overall a new fantastic movie"}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 5, "isInterested": null, "comment": "heart warming :) thumbs up"}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 5, "isInterested": null, "comment": "This movie had no right to be this good.
