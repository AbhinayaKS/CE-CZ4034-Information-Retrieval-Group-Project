Our main man Stanley Cooper sports 2 inch thick glasses which turn his eyes cartoonishly big and right away you're rooting for him no matter what may befall him. What's in store is a journey full of ironic coincidences and secret motivations that one can only smirk along with as each character gets exactly what's coming to them. That's not to say this is predictable. No one is safe and there are surprises along the way you're sure not to see coming."}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 5, "isInterested": null, "comment": "funny, witty, gorgeous, good script, lucky enough to see it during shawnee hometown opening."}]}}, "emsId": "2ef4b428-1401-44eb-ae4d-288a85abb12c", "emsVersionId": "f546b781-a788-425e-874e-0237bade20c0", "movie_name": "Neon Cactus"}
