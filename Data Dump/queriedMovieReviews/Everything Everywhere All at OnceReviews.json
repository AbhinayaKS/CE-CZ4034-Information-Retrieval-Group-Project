There are a lot of laugh-out-loud moments, the acting is very, very good, the overall theme is interesting, and the staging and special effects are excellent. But, the plot is very confusing if you don't pay close attention, the big mcguffin turns out to be some sort of inside joke, and the ending is sappy. Still, I'm glad I went. Just seeing Jamie Lee Curtis as an attacking monster was worth it - scary and hilarious. But now I won't be able to see her hot scenes in True Lies without flashing on these newer images - which is kind of like the plot of this movie!"}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 0.5, "isInterested": null, "comment": "One of the most 3rd class movie"}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 4, "isInterested": null, "comment": "Confusing, weird, clever (subtitles needed otherwise you miss so much!!).

The point it makes - that we have a deep need to feel seen and understood, somehow, and we'll take ANY how - is worth the watch, and the film does a great job in getting us there without seeming too heavy-handed.\n\nMy only criticism was that it ended abruptly - I could have surfed a bit longer on the \"All At Once\" theme."}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 0.5, "isInterested": null, "comment": "It was so bad, tiring to watch, overdoing effects and failing over and over in what seemed to be endless pointless absurdity.
