If 'Your Place Or Mine' (Netflix) failed to launch as last Valetine's major rom-com (still not sure if the flop was actually about Ashton Kutcher's career in light years or was Zoe Chao supposed to resemble Demi Moore?), Michael Jacobs' adaptation of his original play 'Cheaters' was just right on time with its tougue-in-cheek dramas and enough excuses on infidelity that couldn't actually look better on both Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon. It's agreeable for every viewer that sparkling reunion can be pulled off by only these two most sterling pair of a silver fox and a ginger vixen onscreen eighteen years after Peter Chelsom's unforgettable 'Shall We Dance? (Miramax Films) and, suffice to say, Sarandon's plastic surgery job did pay off marvelously for her age and injury from the fall accident in 2019.\n\nAnd then, our complimentary dessert gets a little too saccharine and addictive. Diane Keaton's nestor housewife character, opposite Gere as the vulnerable devoted husband and his first extramarital affair partner played by Sarandon, who would develop an intimate friendship with her admirer coindentally the latter's husband (William H. Macy) was cool as dope like Tig Notaro who played the uncanny best friend of Reese Witherspoon's single mother character in 'Mine'. Best still, crunches inside the dessert as you sank your teeth in are both couple's children (played by Emma Roberts and Luke Bracey) about to tie the knot. Incest trouples.\n\nWIthout paying attention to the credits, the poster design and cast assemble of Jacob's directional debut have a similar appearance and qualities in common with Nancy Meyers' work but more of a multi-generational modern rom-com with upclose sentimentality in how the characters under the same roofs eventually had to deal with everything's hidden from the surface of lifelong or soon-to-wed relationships.\n\nA scrambling, hilarious but hopeful take on love, marriage, and happiness. The only fallout of the screenplay is that the least good-looking Macy's character did not sail off quite well like others in the ending.\n\nOriginally distributed by Vertical Films in association with production from Fifth Season and Vincent Newman Entertainment."}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 3.5, "isInterested": null, "comment": "It wasn't great but it also wasn't bad. It is a strange movie because it seems to have originally been a play but when it was adapted it still feels like a play.

It's slightly funny, very, very slightly funny. The whole flick is mainly carried by Emma's charm and the eternal perfection of William H. Macy. The rest of the cast seems only to have done the bare minimum to get their pay check. We all know this kind of person among a company's employees who come to work, sign in and then just sit around, read the newspaper or hang on their phone all day long before signing out at the end of the day. Well, that's pretty much what the whole cast of this movie did, except the first two mentioned. It is pretty much like a theater play forced onto the big screen, completely forgetting that you have more possibilities on the big screen and don't have to limit your scenario to the bare minimum like on a stage. The chitchat is mainly forced and seems to have come from a school play, thus keeps you bored throughout most of the fortunately short 90 minutes. 3/10 points"}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 1, "isInterested": null, "comment": "Lo escribir\u00e9 en espa\u00f1ol para poder expresarme mejor, la pel\u00edcula no tiene sentido, las historia es muy confusa, la manera en que narran las diferentes historias es lenta y las conversaciones eran totalmente absurdas.\n\nNo tiene un prop\u00f3sito la pel\u00edcula ni un fin, solamente fue ver la misma actuaci\u00f3n de emma roberts y lo inc\u00f3modo que te hacen sentir las conversaciones sin sentido."}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 5, "isInterested": null, "comment": "It's a fun little movie, I had a good time"}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 0.5, "isInterested": null, "comment": "What a waist of time..
