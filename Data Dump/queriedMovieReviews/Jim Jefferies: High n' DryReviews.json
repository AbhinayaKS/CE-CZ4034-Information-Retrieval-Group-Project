The bits on either side of the nearly 15 minute trans rant are salvageable, some even approach the concept of comedy, but largely this felt like an \"edgy\" comic screaming into the void. \"They cut the dick off, then scoop out the innards with a spoon,\" is a paraphrased quote directly from the special. Unless children are his target audience, Jefferies should try to craft some jokes for adults next time."}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 5, "isInterested": null, "comment": "Honestly the best comedy show I've seen, it's as raunchy as it can get and that's what makes true great comedy imo."}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 3, "isInterested": null, "comment": "Not his strongest special but Jim Jeffries is still going strong.

Jim Jeffries is back with this Netflix special filmed in Canada and it is very, very funny.   Jim has not changed one ounce of his vulgar, raucously funny and vitriolic humor.    His unique approach to talking about himself and the world through personal narrative and commentary on some of the modern lunacy we experience every day is great.   Jim's connection with his audience is magnetic.   His use of his language and his Australian accents, as well as his understanding of the image he has created, are all tools in his comedy arsenal.   I loved this special as much as I loved his prior ones, and that is a whole lot."}, {"userFullName": null, "userImage": null, "iconImage": null, "rating": 1, "isInterested": null, "comment": "This pains me to say this, but Jim you've lost your touch!\nI fell asleep.."}]}}, "emsId": "1d3614d3-0daa-4de4-9216-7f38188656d2", "emsVersionId": "1d3c2770-7d82-43ce-bb0a-efa8b41d2060", "movie_name": "Jim Jefferies: High n' Dry"}
